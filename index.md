My name is Teona Bagashvili and I am from Tbilisi, Georgia. I am a junior at Allegheny College, majoring in Computer Science. My primary research interest is applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) to various tasks such as automated software testing, data analysis, NLP. My current research is using machine learning techniques for automated analysis of Git Repositories to support predictions and interventions with builds and commits. I also enjoy exploring the area of computer vision and applying it to solve various problems, such as the automated assembly of the jigsaw puzzles. Please check out other pages for more information about my involvement in research and projects.
